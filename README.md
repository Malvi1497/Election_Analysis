She won with a big leap when compared to her competitors Charles Casper Stockham, who received 23% (85,213) of the total votes and Raymon Anthony Doane who received only 3.1% (11,606) of the overall votes.

## Election Audit Summary
There are many ways to use Python to perform further analysis with additional data,
* We can use the same scripting with data from 50 states to perform the same for state elections. 
* With additional data, such as demographics and geographical locations, scripting can be changed in a way to determine the geographical significance of each candidate to check their popularity.
* With additional data such as bypoll results we can also determine and compare the difference in the actual results with the bypoll reults.
